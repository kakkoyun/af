# ADR-051: Testing Strategy

## Context

`af` v1 is a CLI that orchestrates `git`, `tmux`, `ssh`, `slicer`,
`sbx`, agent CLIs, and a keyring. None of those should run during unit
tests; the tests need **interface seams** for the IO surface and
**testscript** for the integration surface.

v0 ADR-018 introduced a `CommandRunner` trait, then v0 ADR-029 dropped
it in favour of feature gates + assert_cmd. v1 takes a third path
that's cleaner in Go: each `internal/<pkg>/` defines a narrow
interface for its IO needs; production code uses real impls; tests
use fakes.

## Decision

### Test layers

| Layer                    | Tool                              | Scope                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Unit                     | stdlib `testing`                  | Pure logic in `internal/<pkg>/`. No external processes.                                                                                             |
| Property                 | stdlib `testing/quick`            | Invariants over generated inputs (naming, sanitization, lifecycle transitions). No external processes.                                              |
| Integration (mocked CLI) | `rogpeppe/go-internal/testscript` | `cmd/af/...` end-to-end against a built binary. **No real `tmux`/`ssh`/`slicer`/`sbx`** — fakes are injected via per-scenario env vars (see below). |
| Manual smoke (out-of-CI) | (none)                            | Real `tmux`, `ssh`, `slicer`, `sbx`. Owner runs the full flow on a workstation before merging risky PRs.                                            |

### Interface seams (replaces v0 CommandRunner)

Each `internal/<pkg>/` that does IO defines one or more **narrow**
interfaces (3–5 methods) capturing exactly its IO needs. Production
impls call out to real systems; test fakes implement the same
interface in memory.

```go
// internal/git/git.go (sketch)
type Git interface {
    WorktreeAdd(ctx context.Context, root, branch, base, target string) error
    WorktreeRemove(ctx context.Context, root, target string) error
    BranchExists(ctx context.Context, root, name string) (bool, error)
    CurrentBranch(ctx context.Context, root string) (string, error)
}

// production
type Exec struct{}
func (Exec) WorktreeAdd(ctx context.Context, root, branch, base, target string) error {
    return exec.CommandContext(ctx, "git", "-C", root, "worktree", "add", ...).Run()
}

// test fake
type Fake struct {
    Calls []string
    // ...
}
```

Same pattern for `internal/mux`, `internal/agent`, `internal/sandbox`,
`internal/remote`, `internal/secret`. Each provides a `Fake` (or
`Stub`) sibling type for tests.

### `testing/quick` for properties

Properties to verify:

- `Sanitize(s)` is idempotent (`Sanitize(Sanitize(s)) == Sanitize(s)`).
- `ApplyPrefix(name, prefix)` doesn't double-apply.
- Workstream lifecycle transitions form a valid DAG (no `completed → active`).
- UUID v5 derivation: same inputs → same output.

Each property test runs N=100 iterations with random inputs from
`testing/quick.Generate` defaults.

### `testscript` for CLI golden tests

`cmd/af/testdata/script/<scenario>.txt` files describe end-to-end
flows:

```
# version.txt
exec af version
stdout '^af dev \\(none, unknown\\)$'
! stderr .
```

The initial scaffold covers `af version` and `af --help`. Later command
scenarios grow from that baseline, for example:

```
# create.txt
exec af setup
exec af create --agent pi mytask
exec af list
stdout 'mytask\s+active'
exec af suspend mytask
exec af list
stdout 'mytask\s+suspended'
exec af resume mytask
exec af done mytask --force
```

The framework runs each scenario in an isolated tempdir with mocked
external commands. Real `tmux`, `ssh`, `slicer`, `sbx` are **never**
invoked from testscript; instead, the harness prepends a per-scenario
fake-command directory (`AF_TEST_FAKEBIN`) to `PATH`, and the binary's
interface seams (`Multiplexer`, `Agent`, `Sandbox`, `Remote`) can read
env vars like `AF_TEST_MUX=fake` at start-up to load in-process fakes.
The fakes implement the same interfaces; their behaviour is configurable
per scenario via `script` directives. ADR-040 §"Testing"
cross-references this arrangement.

### What's NOT tested

| Concern                    | Why not                                   |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Real tmux server           | Requires CI tmux; fragile across versions |
| Real ssh to a real host    | Requires network + persistent infra       |
| Real slicer/sbx VMs        | Requires Firecracker/Docker daemons       |
| Real Anthropic/OpenAI APIs | Requires keys + costs money               |

These are exercised manually before risky PRs. The owner runs `af
create` against a real machine, observes correct behaviour, then
ships.

### Coverage target

`internal/<pkg>/` packages with **no IO** (e.g. `internal/naming`,
`internal/uuid`, `internal/config` excluding loaders): **80%+**.

`internal/<pkg>/` packages with IO use interface fakes; coverage on the
production impl is necessarily lower because the impl just shells out.

`cmd/af/` is exercised by testscript; line coverage there is whatever
the scenarios drive.

No coverage gate in CI for v1 (single-user; pragmatism wins). The
owner monitors `go test -cover` output during development.

### `go test` invocation

```bash
go test -race -count=1 -shuffle=on ./...
```

- `-race` catches concurrent-access bugs.
- `-count=1` disables the test cache (avoids stale state confusing investigation).
- `-shuffle=on` randomises test order (catches inter-test coupling).

### `make test`

```make
test:
	go test -race -count=1 -shuffle=on ./...

test-property:
	go test -run TestProperty -count=10000 -timeout 120s ./...
```

The property-only target runs more iterations than the default for
deeper exploration.

## Consequences

- Unit tests are deterministic and fast (no real systems touched).
- Integration tests are realistic (built binary against scripted scenarios).
- Coverage is high where it counts (pure logic) without fighting the IO surface.
- Adding a new package means adding its interface seam; subagents working on a package own its tests.

## Alternatives Considered

- **`CommandRunner` trait (v0)**. Rejected per v0 ADR-029's reasoning: pollutes call sites with a runtime-injected dep. Per-package narrow interfaces are cleaner.
- **`assert_cmd` equivalent in Go**. The `os/exec` + golden-output pattern in `testscript` covers this; no separate library needed.
- **Real tmux in CI** via `xvfb`/headless. Rejected; fragile and slow.
- **Coverage gate at 80%**. Rejected for v1; would block legitimate IO-bound code.
